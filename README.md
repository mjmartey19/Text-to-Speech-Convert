# Text-to-Speech-Convert
Text-to-speech (TTS) conversion is the process of converting written text into spoken words using computer software. This technology is also sometimes referred to as "speech synthesis."

In TTS conversion, a computer program analyzes written text and generates a synthetic voice that reads the text aloud. The resulting audio can be played back through speakers or headphones, or integrated into other applications or devices, such as voice assistants or navigation systems.

TTS conversion can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as for people with visual impairments, language learners, or anyone who wants to consume written content in a spoken format. TTS can also be used to automate voice prompts and instructions for phone systems, chatbots, or virtual assistants.

The quality of TTS conversion has improved significantly in recent years, and many TTS engines now use neural networks and machine learning algorithms to produce more natural-sounding voices. Some TTS systems also allow users to customize the voice or adjust settings such as pitch, speed, or accent.

Overall, TTS conversion is a powerful tool for converting written text into spoken words, and it has the potential to improve accessibility, convenience, and efficiency in a variety of settings.
